# MEOM server cal1

## Description

cal1 is a server that allows you to access MEOM data and connect to other servers (like french super computers)

It is accessible from anywhere (IGE or your home) at the adress : ```ige-meom-cal1.u-ga.fr```

## Access and workspaces

As soon as you have an agalan account (IGE login), you can have an account there (ask [Aurélie](mailto:aurelie.albert@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr) to authorize your login) and you can connect via ssh : ```ssh -CX yourlogin@ige-meom-cal1.u-ga.fr```

It is recommended to implement a ssh key from anywhere you want to connect to it, so that you do not have to type your password everytime (the server can ban you very quickly if you enter a wrong password, in that case contact Aurélie with you IP adress so that you can be unban):
  - in your local machine type : ```ssh-keygen``` (unless you already have a key)
  - it will create a file .ssh/id_rsa.pub
  - copy it to cal1 via the command : ```ssh-copy-id yourlogin@ige-meom-cal1.u-ga.fr``` and type your password for the last time

You will have access to 2 personnal workspaces : ```/home/yourlogin``` (automatically created) and ```/mnt/summer/DATA_MEOM/workdir/yourlogin``` (Aurélie will create it when authorizing your login), the first one is limited in space and you should only put scripts on it, the second is like a scratch where your temporary and results files should be stored.

You can see how much of these spaces are filled with the command ```df -h``` (look for /home and /mnt/summer/DATA_MEOM to see how much space is left)

You can transfer data from your computer to cal1 with the command ```scp myfile yourlogin@ige-meom-cal1.u-ga.fr:/mnt/summer/DATA_MEOM/workdir/yourlogin/where_you_want_it/myfile``` and you can download data from cal1 to your computer with the command : ```scp yourlogin@ige-meom-cal1.u-ga.fr:/mnt/summer/DATA_MEOM/workdir/yourlogin/path_to_your_file/myfile .```
